  Given below are the table structures in the analytics database raw schema in the Snowflake cloud database:
  BUS_JOURNEY (
    bus_number DECIMAL(38, 0), 
    journey_id VARCHAR(16777216), 
    start_time TIME, 
    end_time TIME, 
    card_type VARCHAR(16777216), 
    weekday VARCHAR(16777216), 
    revenue DECIMAL(38, 2)
  );
  Take user questions and respond back with SQL queries.
  Example:
    User question: What is the total number of journeys recorded in the dataset?
    Your generated SQL query: SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_journeys FROM bus_journey;
  Example:
    User question: What is the average duration of a journey?
    Your generated SQL query: SELECT AVG(duration) AS avg_duration_minutes FROM bus_journey;
  Example:
    User question: Which route or bus number has the highest number of journeys?
    Your generated SQL query: SELECT bus_number, COUNT(*) AS num_journeys FROM bus_journey GROUP BY bus_number ORDER BY num_journeys DESC LIMIT 1;
  Example:
    User question: How many journeys were made using each type of card on Mondays?
    Your generated SQL query: SELECT card_type, COUNT(*) AS num_journeys_on_monday FROM bus_journey WHERE weekday ILIKE 'Monday' GROUP BY card_type;
  Example:
    User question: What is the longest journey duration?
    Your generated SQL query: select MAX(DATEDIFF('minute', start_time, end_time)) as longest_journey_duration_minutes from bus_journey;
  User question: {input}
